<ul>
<li><strong>node</strong> <em>selector</em>: a css-selector</li>
<li><strong>callback</strong> <em>function</em>: the code that will be executed, returns the event target</li>
<li><strong>action</strong> <em>boolean</em>: set to <code>false</code> if the element that has to be detected isn't defined by a <code>data-action</code> attribute</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>You would use this function if you want to limit the eventlisteners you add to a page.</p>
<p><strong>How you would use this function</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add it inside an eventlistener</li>
<li>Set the selector-parameter to the css-selector of the element that you want to detect</li>
<li>Add code that has to be executed when the element is detected</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Stand-alone function, outside eventlistener;</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;button data-do=&quot;hideMenu&quot;&gt;hide menu&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
    menustuff...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">eventCallback('btn[data-do=&quot;hideMenu&quot;]', (target) =&gt; {
    hideSomething(target);
}, false)
</code></pre>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>When the function is launched it watches the target element of the eventlistener. If the css-selector of this element matches the given selector the callback will be executed.</p>
<p>So you could have a couple of buttons, with like a data-attribute, with inside them an icon and some span-elements. What would happen in a normal case: you'd click inside the button, on a span. But on the click event you want to return the value of the data-attribute. Since you clicked on that span element inside the button it would return nothing and probably break a function or two since it doesn't returns a value.</p>
<p>Now with this function you'd click inside the button, but with the css-selector set to something like <code>button[data-do-on-click]</code> you could click inside the button, on a span, the function would only return the button, so the css-selector works like a filter and will select the element closest to it.</p>
